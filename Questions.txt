"If the user attempts to log in unsuccessfully using any Userid twice in 1 day, the user is warned 
 that there is only one more opportunity to successfully log in before the account will be locked. 
 After the third failure to log in the Userid is locked. See Requirement yyy - Unlocking and 
 Resetting User Identification."

1.
 a. If they are "logging in with any Userid, " which one gets locked?
 b. Should we keep track of failed logins by the session, or by the Userid?

2. Should the user's login cookie expire based off of time, or when they leave the site? - If time, how much?
